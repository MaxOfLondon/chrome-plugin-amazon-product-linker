# Amazon Product Linker

'Amazon Product Linker' will create link to a product page of active Amazon tab and send it the clipboard for easy sharing. The link does not require user to be loged into Amazon to see the product page unlike when address is copied from browser's address bar. This adds some annomity, reduces tracking and targetted advertising by Amazon. The product links are stored in local cache and synchronised between Chrome browsers if user is logged onto Chrome. List of created links is accessible from plugin Options. It can be conviniently fomatted with addtional metadata like date & time or product description and used to share multiple links. The list can be cleared and history logging disabled as necessary.
