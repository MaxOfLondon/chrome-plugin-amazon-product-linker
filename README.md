# Amazon Product Linker

'Amazon Product Linker' will create link to a product page of active Amazon tab and send it to the clipboard for easy sharing. The received link does not require user to be loged into Amazon to see the product page unlike when address is copied and shared from the browser's address bar. This adds some anonymity, reduces tracking and targetted advertising by Amazon. The product links are stored in local cache and synchronised between Chrome browsers if user is logged in to Chrome. List of previously created links can be seen on plugin Options page. The list can be fomatted with addtional metadata like date & time or product description and then used to share multiple links as needed. The list can be cleared and history logging disabled if not required.
